Hi
The Tor Project works for advancements of human rights.
Tor is a virtual tunnelling program that enables you to increase your digital privacy and security. It secures you by routing your communications 
via a distributed network of relays operated by volunteers all across the globe, avoiding someone observing your Internet connection from learning the sites you visit and the sites you visit from discovering your actual location.
