Hello everybody!
This blog post is about introducing you to the organization I've been working with, The Tor project.

_“ Privacy is a human right. We at Tor advance human rights and defend your privacy online through FOSS.”_

<p>The Tor Project works for advancements of human rights through free and open-source software. <br>
We're becoming a world where most of our day-to-day activities are being shifted to the web. At such crucial times, digital privacy and security should be your outmost concern as it is equally important.<br>
 You might not be even aware about <b><i>how much</i></b> information you're giving access to over the internet. The targeted ads that follow for weeks clearly depicts, we’re being tracked at all times. It’s high time we redeem our rights, because privacy is a human right!</p>

<p>Tor is a program that enables you to increase your digital privacy and security. It secures you by routing your connections via a distributed network of relays operated by volunteers across the globe. Tor aims to solve the main privacy problems - websites and other services can use your location to build databases about your habits and interests. <b>Tor prevents this.</b>
 <br>It avoids someone observing your Internet connection from learning the sites you visit and the sites you visit from discovering your actual location.
</p>
With Tor, your Internet connections don't give you away by default - unless you provide (by filling out forms). Now you've the ability to control what and how much information you wish to reveal.

<h2><b>How Tor works?</b></h2> 
There's this nice picture on the [Tor Browser Manual](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/about/) that explains how the software functions:

Tor works by sending your traffic through 3 random servers (also known as relays) in the Tor network.
The last relay in the circuit (exit relay) then sends the traffic out onto the public Internet.
Your communication is encrypted in many layers and routed via many hops through the Tor network to the final receiver.
