Hello, world!:D<br>
I'm Kulsoom Zahra 
<p>
My core values are <br>
<strong>1.Growth -</strong> I firmly believe the quote <em>Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever<em> . I strive to be better by each passing day that's why I value growth. Opensource is where we, as a whole community come together to evolve, learn, build and share ideas. It's like a treasure pool of knowledge.
<strong>2.Optimism -</strong><em>"The way we see the problem is the problem. ~Stephen Covey "<em>. So make sure you plant some good thoughts in your heads and never loose hope in the good. Don't forget to pluck out the weeds ;) . They may kill your ambitions, which in turn may fuel your Impostor Syndrome!
So hey, HANG ON! You can do it. 
<strong>3.Compassion -</strong> <em>“If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.”
― Mother Teresa</em>
Everyone fights their own battles, the least you can do is be kind and welcoming. Grow and help others grow. It costs nothing plus you feel so lively from within.
