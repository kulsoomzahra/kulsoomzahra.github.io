Hello, world!:D<br>
I'm Kulsoom Zahra 
<p>
My core values are <br>
1.**Growth -** I firmly believe the quote "_Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever_" . I strive to be better by each passing day that's why I value growth. Opensource is where we, as a whole community come together to evolve, learn, build and share ideas. It's like a treasure pool of knowledge.
2.**Optimism -** _"The way we see the problem is the problem. ~Stephen Covey "_ . So make sure you plant some good thoughts in your heads and never loose hope in the good. Don't forget to pluck out the weeds ;) . They may kill your ambitions, which in turn may fuel your Impostor Syndrome!
So hey, HANG ON! You can do it. 
3.**Compassion -** _“If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.”
― Mother Teresa_
  
Everyone fights their own battles, the least you can do is be kind and welcoming. Grow and help others grow. It costs nothing plus you feel so lively from within.
