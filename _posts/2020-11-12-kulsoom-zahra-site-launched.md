Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
Kudos! I believe you just need to better than as you were yesterday . So keep going!!
