Today I read an article on GIT - a Version Control Software.
Although I knew about it but this article made things simpler. Some highlights-
<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>Initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005</p>
<p>Version control software allows the user to have “versions” of a project, which show the changes that were made to the code over time, and allows the user to backtrack if necessary and undo those changes.</p>
This is the primary reason why developers all round the world are using Git , Github.
