Today I read an article on GIT - a Version Control Software.
Although I knew about it but this article made things simpler.
<li>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</li>
<li>Initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005</li>
<li>Version control software allows the user to have “versions” of a project, which show the changes that were made to the code over time, and allows the user to backtrack if necessary and undo those changes.</li>
This is the primary reason why developers all round the world are using Git , Github.
