So I decided to built a twitter bot for my senior project at university . Here's something about it..
<p>Twitter is one of the most widely used social networks.
For many organizations and people, having a great Twitter presence is a
key factor to keeping their audience engaged.
Part of having a great Twitter presence involves keeping your account active
with new tweets and retweets, following interesting accounts, and quickly replying
to your followersâ€™ messages. You can do all this work manually, but that can
take a lot of time. Instead, you can rely on a Twitter Bot, a program that
automates all or part of your Twitter activity.</p>
<p><em><b>What is a bot?</b></em></p>

Definition
bot (robot) 
<p>A bot -- short for "robot" and also called an internet bot -- is a computer program that operates as an agent for a user or other program, or to simulate a human activity. Bots are normally used to automate certain tasks, meaning they can run without specific instructions from humans.</p>
