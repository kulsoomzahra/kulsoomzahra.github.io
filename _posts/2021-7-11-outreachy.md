Hello everybody! :)<br>
This blog post is about the progress i've made dunring the first half of my internship.

Halfway through the internship and feels like I just started a week or two ago. Time flies, perhaps the time you're busy learning and working to improve yourself flies faster. I aspire to live by this goal of constantly reflecting upon thyself, what else can be done, what am i lacking etc etc.

In the past one and a half month or so, I, along with my Commuity team was able to solve around 210+ tickets on the RT.
As per the original timeline, Tor Browser 10.5 was supposed to be released on the first week of June. But due to some reasons, the release was delayed to the 6th of July. So, what we did instead was, changed the order of the priorities a little bit and shifted our focus onto the Request Tracker, 
creating and updating user templates and composing the User feed back report. 

<h2><b>Challenges whilst documenting</b></h2> 

Tor Browser has now changed, with the new user interface the connecting is different and it's obvious many users are going to get confused around it. While documenting such changes, our primary focus is to deliver content that is not complicated, and also precise enough to convey all details. This is a cruial time.
