Hello everybody! :)<br>
This blog post is about the progress i've made during the first half period of my internship.

Halfway through the internship and feels like I just started a week or two ago. Time flies, perhaps the time you're busy, either learning something new or figuring out new ways to improve yourself, flies faster. I aspire to live by this goal of constantly reflecting upon thyself, what else can be done, what am i lacking etc etc.

In the past one and a half month or so, I, along the Commuity team were able to solve around **210+** tickets on the Tor Project's RT. Prima facie, RT seemed a complex thing to handle but, slowly things became more familiar and i was enjoying handling tickets. My mentor helped me throughout the time. We used to discuss RT things, related challenges and he used to suggest me ways i could improve.

As per the original timeline, **Tor Browser 10.5** was supposed to be released on the first week of June. But due to some reasons, the release was delayed to the 6th of July. So, what we did instead was, changed the order of the priorities a little bit, and shifted our focus onto the Request Tracker, 
creating and updating user templates and composing the User Feedback Report. This report puts together all the major UI/UX pain points faced by users of Tor and Tor Browser. It covers a wide variety of subjects ranging from UI/UX to anti-censorship to debugging, and so forth. 

<h2><b>Update the Tor Browser Manual</b></h2> 

Tor Browser has now changed. With the new user interface, the connecting is different and it's obvious many users are going to get confused around it. While documenting such changes, our primary focus is to deliver content that is **_not complicated_**, and also _**precise enough to convey all details**_. This is a cruial time. Last week we updated the manual to reflect the new connecting experience and explain some of the new terms.
