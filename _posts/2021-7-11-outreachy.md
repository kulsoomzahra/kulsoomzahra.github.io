As per the original timeline, Tor Browser 10.5 was supposed to be released on the first week of June. But due to some reasons, the release was delayed to the 6th of July. So, we changed a
little bit the order of the priorities. Instead of updating the documentation, shifted focus onto the Request Tracker, 
creating and updating user templates and composing the User feed back report. 

Tor Browser has now changed, with the new user interface the connecting is different and it's obvious many users are going to get confused around it. While documenting such changes, 
our primary focus is to deliever content that is not complicated and also precise enough to convey all details. This is a cruial time.
