	<h1>About me:</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Kulsoom Zahra . I recently attended Bachelors of Computer Science and Applications at <a href="https://www.amu.ac.in"> Aligarh Muslim University </a>, India.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the moment, I'm more in the <em>exploring</em> stage rather than <em>developing</em>. But anyhow I've managed to explore some domains and build stuff out of it too. 

			Besides this I'm also working on my problem solving skills.
		</p>
		<p>
		 I always try to be the best in every endeavor I take up. I aspire to be a good programmer writing excellent testcases, debugging code and just nailing anything I do!  &#128521
		</p>
		<p>
		I beleive I'm a fast learner who is keen to learn new skills, techs and take up new challenges.
